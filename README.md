# TCPEncryptedChat

If you want the chat to have a custom theme, just make a folder called "custom_themes" and make a file called red1.json then just use <a href="https://github.com/avalon60/ctk_theme_builder">this tool made by avalon60</a> to make a theme. The icecream module is not required, you can just comment it out.
